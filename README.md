# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
In this project I applied different classification (KNN and DT) and Clustering (K-Means) on a breast cancer dataset from Kaggle. First, I read, preprocess and clean the dataset (crunching), analyzed, visualized the dataset using NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib python libraries. And from graphs I get some variance and correlation between features so I can make feature selection among the features to build the models. Then after selecting 'area_mean' and 'texture_mean' as the features of my models I split the dataset into training and testing set to begin classification then I applied the KNN and DT model and compare their accuracy and performance metrics using Sklearn python library.
